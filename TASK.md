## Conway's Game of Life

A cellualr automaton is a system of cells that exists in a grid it could be in one or many dimensions. In the game of life there are two dimensions. The idea is that you have generations that change by some computation for each generation. The computation is really just the rules that you can find with the link below. These rules will decide the each cell's state, in our cases, 0 or 1 (Alive or dead). Please use the link below to learn the rules. The goal is to create a JavaScript app that console.log() the output of the cells.

[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

For the first version of the project you should implement a solution with the following: 

* that has a grid of at least 25 by 25

* Alive cells should be poulated randomly

* The game should be outputted to the user for at least 20 seconds
